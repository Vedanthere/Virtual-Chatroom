## _**The Website**_
1. Our group decided to create a dynamic simulated virtual classroom application that allows 
users to create and/or join existing chat rooms to communicate with each other in real time via messages. 
When creating a new room, the server assigns a random alphanumeric code as the "Room ID". 
Upon joining a new room, users will be asked to enter a username. 
Additionally, It will announce a message when a new user has joined that specific 
room with timestamps of each chat message. <br><br>
We have also added some additional features to enhance the users' experience. 
This includes things such as a Tic-Tac-Toe game, a White board (to draw), a To Do list (add/manage tasks), 
and a Number guessing game (for some memes/to relieve stress). 

##  _**How to run:**_
    1. Clone the repository.
    2. Navigate to project directory.
    3. Open development environment (preferably Intellij).
    4. Start the server using GlassFish (under edit configurations).
    5. Open the server/html page in firefox for a better/enhanced experience 
    6. Click enter to enter a new chat room and start chatting.
    7. After clicking enter, if the user wants to join an existing chatroom, click the button for that room on the left.
    8. To start chatting, first enter your username, then you can start typing messages.
    9. if you want to leave a chat room, simply switch rooms or refresh/exit that browser tab.
        
    How to run Additional Features:
    1. To run the White board, click on the "White board" text on the navigation bar (top of page).
       Once on the White board page, first click on the colour selector to select a colour, 
       then type a stroke size and start drawing. To clear the canvas, simply click clear. 

    2. To run the tic-tac-toe game, scroll down to the bottom of the page and start playing 
       with another player (LAN). 

    3. To run the Guessing game, click on the "Memes" text on the navigation bar located at the top of the page. Once 
       you are on the Guessing game page you enter your number guess while the application would randomly 
       generate a random number between 1 and 10 and when you click the guess button the application will determine 
       if the user is right/wrong. The application would display images based on the user's guess whether it be too 
       high/low and if they got it right then they succeeded in playing the game. Should they want to play again they 
       simply have to input the same/different number and click the guess button once again to run the application.

    4. To run task list, click on the "Task List" text on the navigation bar. Once you are on the To Do Task List, you
       can create and manage tasks using "Add Task" button. This allows users to mark tasks as complete.  Once you have 
       completed a task, simply hover over it and click on the check mark to delete it. This feature comes with a hovering 
       effects to provide a more interactive experience for the users. Whether it is a group project or individual, this will help them keep track of their progress and ensure their success.
