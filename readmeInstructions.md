# Web Chat Server

### Project Information: 
Dynamic web chat application that allows users to create and/or 
join existing chat rooms and communicate with each other in 
real time. When creating a new room, the server assigns a 
random alphanumeric code. Upon joining a new room, users will 
be asked to enter a username and the server will acknowledge 
the welcome message. Additionally, It will announce a message 
when a new user has joined the same specific room with 
timestamps of each chat message sent.
